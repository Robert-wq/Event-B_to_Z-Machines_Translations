1. Bridge_Controller.thy - This is a legacy version bridge controller before operational refinement was added to Z-   Machines. It was maintained as a comparison of adding the keyword.

2. Bridge_Controller_Refine.thy - This the most complete version of the bridge controller example. It includes the use operational refinement

3. File_Transfer_Protocol.thy - In Abrial's he creates two versions of the Simple FTP. This is the first, more simple version.

4. File_Transfer_Protocol_Revisited.thy - This is the second version of the FTP mentioned in 3.

5. Mechanical_Lung_Ventilator.thy - This is what was implemented in the mechanical lung ventilator example

6. Mechanical_Press_Refine.thy - This is what was implemented of the mechanical press example. 

7. Water_Tank_Controller.thy - Contains the water tank example.
